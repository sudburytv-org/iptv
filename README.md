A curated collection of publicly available IPTV channels from North America (USA & Canada) and the United Kingdom, formatted as M3UEXT playlists. This project focuses on channels broadcasting primarily in **English and French**.

**Disclaimer:** This project aggregates publicly available IPTV channel links. We do not host or stream any content ourselves.  Channel availability and legality may vary. Use at your own risk and respect copyright holders.

**Key Features:**

* **Curated Lists:**  Playlists are manually curated to ensure quality and relevance (as much as possible with publicly available streams).
* **English & French Focus:**  Prioritizes channels broadcasting in English and French languages.
* **M3UEXT Format:**  Standard M3UEXT playlists compatible with most IPTV players (VLC, Kodi, etc.).
* **Open Source & Community Driven:**  Open to contributions and community improvements.
* **Regularly Updated:**  Playlists will be updated periodically to maintain channel availability (depending on community contributions).

**Project Goals:**

* Provide a central, easy-to-use resource for publicly available North American and UK IPTV channels.
* Offer a curated and filtered selection, focusing on English and French content.
* Encourage community contributions to expand and maintain the channel lists.
